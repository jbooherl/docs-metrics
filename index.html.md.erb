## <a id='log-store'></a> About the Log Store

In App Metrics, Log Store provides a persistent storage layer for logs sent through Loggregator.

Log Store has the following features:

* **Multi-tenant aware:** Log Store uses the auth proxy to ensure that app developers can only access their own logs.

* **Ubiquitous query language:** Log Store uses a PromQL style label selector query for filtering logs.

* **Powerful storage engine:** Log store uses the InfluxDB storage engine, which has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index. For more
information about the InfluxDB storage engine, see [InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb).

Log Store offers multinode deployments, data replication, and load balancing in a highly-available configuration.
