This document describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

For information about the components deployed as part of this install procedure,
see [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html).


##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before you install or upgrade PCF Metrics, you must do the following:


+ **For PCF Metrics v1.6.4:**
If you are upgrading, you first need to delete the appmetrics_nodejs8_buildpack if it exists via the [cf cli](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete-buildpack.html).

+ **For PCF Metrics v1.6.3 and later:**
When you install PCF Metrics, you must have the **Enable custom buildpacks** checkbox
selected in the **App Containers** pane in the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.

    This checkbox is enabled by default.
    You need custom buildpacks enabled because PCF Metrics v1.6.3 and later requires,
    and is packaged with, the custom Node.js buildpack v1.7.8.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PCF Metrics v1.6.3 does not work in air-gapped environments
    because it does not have the offline buildpack packaged with it.
    </p>

+ **For custom metrics:** To use the [Custom Metrics](./monitoringpcfmetrics.html#custom-metrics) feature of the PCF Metrics tile,
you must have the Metrics Forwarder tile installed.
However, the PCF Metrics tile can be installed without the Metrics Forwarder tile.

##<a id='upgrade'></a>Upgrade from v1.4.x to v1.6.x

This section describes upgrading from PCF Metrics v1.4.x to v1.6.x.

###<a id='upgrade-overview'></a> Overview

PCF Metrics version 1.6 includes new data storage solutions that were introduced in version 1.5:

- For logs, versions 1.5 and 1.6 use PostgreSQL instead of ElasticSearch.
- For metrics, versions 1.5 and 1.6 use Percona instead of MariaDB.

There is no effective upgrade path from ElasticSearch to PostgreSQL for logs data. For this reason, the upgrade [Procedure](#upgrade-procedure) is different from previous versions.

###<a id='upgrade-procedure'></a> Procedure

To upgrade to PCF Metrics v1.6 from 1.4.x, Pivotal recommends that you follow this procedure:

1. Upload and install the PCF Metrics v1.6 tile alongside the v1.4 tile. Follow the instructions in the [Install PCF Metrics](#install) section below. <br>PCF Metrics v1.6 supports running both the v1.6 and v1.4 tiles simultaneously. You can install v1.6 manually or automate the installation with a deployment pipeline.
  <%= image_tag('images/ops-man-metrics-tiles-image.png', :alt => "PCF Metrics 1.4 and v1.6 installed in Ops Manager") %>
1. Keep both tiles installed and running for the duration of the logs and metrics retention window you configured in v1.6. This allows data to propagate to the new version.
  * During this time, you can access both dashboards. However, you can no longer access historical metrics and logs data on the v1.4 dashboard after the duration of the logs and metrics retention window you configured in v1.6 has passed.
      * **For v1.4**: Go to `metrics-previous.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
      * **For v1.6**: Go to `metrics.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`. You can also click **View Metrics in Previous Versions** on the v1.6 dashboard to see metrics for the current app on the v1.4 dashboard.
        <%= image_tag('images/previous-link.png', :alt => "View Metrics in Previous Version link") %>

1. Uninstall PCF Metrics v1.4.

##<a id='upgrade'></a>Upgrade from v1.5.x to v1.6.x

As both 1.5 and 1.6 use the same datastore solutions, you can use standard manual or automated upgrade paths to upgrade from PCF Metrics 1.5.x to 1.6.x.

## <a id='install'></a> New Install of PCF Metrics

This section describes how to install the PCF Metrics tile.

### <a id='step1'></a> Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager

   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/apm).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click  **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id='step2'></a>Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

This section describes how to configure the PCF Metrics tile.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following procedures offer a standard configuration. To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity, see <a href="sizing.html">Sizing PCF Metrics for Your System</a>.</p>

1. From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.
1. Follow the procedures below to configure the PCF Metrics tile:
  + [Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks](#az)
  + [Configure Metrics Components](#mc-config)
  + [Configure Resources](#resource-config)
  + [Optional: Forward PCF Metrics Logs to a Syslog Endpoint](#syslog-config)
  + [Import Stemcell](#stemcell)

#### <a id='az'></a> Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks

To configure the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane, do the following:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
   <br>
   PCF Metrics should be installed on the same network the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile uses.
   However, if you do select a different subnet network, then refer to the table below when you configure
   the subnet network in the PAS tile to make sure that you have
   the ports needed for each of the PCF Metrics data services.

    <table border="1" class="nice">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Service</th>
          <th>Port</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>PostgreSQL (Logs Data)</td>
          <td>5524</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MySQL (Metrics Data)</td>
          <td>3306</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Redis (Data Caching and Aggregation)</td>
          <td>6379</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

1. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="mc-config"></a> Configure Metrics Components

To configure the **Metrics Components Config** pane, do the following:

<%= image_tag('images/metrics-components-config.png', :alt => "Metrics App Components Settings") %>

1. Click **Metrics Components Config**.
1. Review the **MySQL Metrics Queue Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound metrics traffic.
1. Review the **PostgreSQL Logs Queue Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound log traffic.
1. Review the **Ingestor Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of Loggregator Firehose traffic.
1. Review the **Metrics API server instance count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate deployments with more apps, metrics, and logs.
1. Review the **Metrics Retention Window** value.
   You can set number of days to retain metrics data from `1` to `14` days.
   PCF Metrics adds one buffer day to your configured value to prevent pruning within your desired retention window. The retention window begins at UTC±00:00 of the current day and goes back the amount of days you enter in this field, plus the one buffer day added by PCF Metrics.
1. Review the **Logs Retention Window** value.
   You can set number of days to retain logs data from `1` to `14` days.
   PCF Metrics adds one buffer day to your configured value to prevent pruning within your desired retention window. The retention window begins at UTC±00:00 of the current day and goes back the amount of days you enter in this field, plus the one buffer day added by PCF Metrics.
1. Review the **Logs Max Retention Percentage** value.
   As a preventative measure, you can set the percentage of disk capacity used before triggering automatic log pruning to prevent Postgres failures. The default is `85`.
1. Review the **Logs Disk Size Pruning Interval** value.
   You can set the length of time between checking the Postgres disk capacity for automated pruning operations. Default is 1 hour.
1. Review the **Log level for push apps** value.
   You can set the log level for the `push-apps` errand to suit your troubleshooting needs. The options are `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`. Default level is `error`.
1. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="resource-config"></a> Configure Resources

To configure the **Resource Config** pane, do the following:

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job.
   For reference, the following table shows the default resource and IP requirements for installing the PCF Metrics tile:

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For Ops Manager v1.9, if you configure a job with persistent disk larger than 2&nbsp;TB,
       you might experience disk partitioning issues with the BOSH Director.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="syslog-config"></a>Optional: Forward PCF Metrics Logs to a Syslog Endpoint

Operators can configure PCF Metrics to forward its process and VM logs to a logging solution through a syslog endpoint.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager 2.4 or later is required to configure PCF Metrics to forward logs to a syslog endpoint. For information about upgrading Ops Manager, see <a href='https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#how-to-upgrade'>PCF Ops Manager 2.4 Release Notes</a>.</p>

To configure PCF Metrics to forward logs to a syslog endpoint, do the following:

1. In the PCF Metrics tile, click **Settings**, then click **Syslog**.
   <%= image_tag('images/syslog2.png', :alt => "Syslog Settings") %>

1. For **Do you want to configure Syslog forwarding?**, select **Yes**.
   <%= image_tag('images/syslog3.png', :alt => "Enable Syslog Form") %>

1. For **Address** and **Port**, enter the address and port of the syslog server. For **Transport Protocol**, select the desired transport protocol.
   <%= image_tag('images/syslog4.png', :alt => "Syslog Config") %>

1. (Optional) Select the **Enable TLS** checkbox to enable TLS. If you enable TLS, enter the **Permitted Peer** and **SSL Certificate**.
   <%= image_tag('images/syslog5.png', :alt => "Syslog TLS Settings") %>

1. For **Queue Size**, enter the number of log messages the syslog server buffer holds before dropping messages. By default, the queue size is 100000.
   <p class='note'><b>Note</b>: Pivotal recommends a queue size of 100000 or less. A queue size larger than 100000 may cause performance issues.</p>
   <%= image_tag('images/syslog6.png', :alt => "Syslog Queue Settings") %>

1. Click **Save**.
