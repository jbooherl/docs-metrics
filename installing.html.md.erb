 Before you begin your installation of App Metrics there are certain prerequisites you need to know.

 ## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Here are your prerequisites to install App Metrics:

* App Metrics requires <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/Metric-Store/1.5/metric-store/GUID-index.html" target="_blank">Metric Store</a> as the metrics datastore. You must install this tile before you install App Metrics.
* If you upgrade from the Metrics v1.x, the App Metrics tile is installed as a separate tile and does not install over the v1.x version of the Metrics tile.
* There is no data migration from v1.x to v2.x of the product.
* To maintain historical data you must install both version tiles side-by-side for two weeks before uninstalling Metrics v1.x

To avoid installation errors, for the Metrics v1.x tile, turn off:

 `Push PCF Metrics Components Errand`.

Allow App Metrics to take possession of the metrics from the Metric Store:

 `Your-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.

Metrics v1.x is accessible at:

 `metrics-previous.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.

## <a id='AddTile'></a>Download App Metrics

<ol>
<li>After you install the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/Metric-Store/1.5/metric-store/GUID-index.html" target="_blank">Metric Store</a> tile in Ops Manager,
    download the App Metrics v2.2 product file from <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/apm" target="_blank">VMware Tanzu Network</a>.</li>
<li>To upload the product file, go to Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, and click <strong>Import a Product</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the plus sign (+) next to the version number of App Metrics to add the tile to your staging area.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureAzs'></a>Configuring availability zones and networks

To start using App Metrics, you must configure the App Metrics tile:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>App Metrics</strong> tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Assign AZs and Networks</strong> and do the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Select an Availability Zone (AZ) for placing singleton jobs.</li>
<li>Select one or more AZs for balancing other jobs.

To create a highly available environment, select multiple AZs and select Network for the App Metrics installation.
</ul>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureProxy'></a>Configuring App Metrics to use HTTP or SOCKS proxy server (Optional)

You can configure App Metrics to use your HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy server for
the Slack application or webhook alerts.

Configure a HTTP or HTTPS Proxy Server through the cf CLI:

1. Log in to cf CLI and run:

    ```console
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o system -s app-metrics-v2
    ```

    Where:

    * `API-URL` is your API endpoint.
    * `USERNAME` is your username.
    * `PASSWORD` is your password.

2. Update the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable and run:

    ```console
    cf set-env appmetrics HTTP_PROXY "http://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
    ```

    or

    ```console
    cf set-env appmetrics HTTPS_PROXY "https://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
    ```

    Where:

    * `PROXY-HOST` is the hostname of your HTTP or HTTPS proxy.
    * `PROXY-PORT` is the port that your HTTP or HTTPS proxy is listening on.

    The HTTP proxy environment variables must be uppercase.

    For more information
    about setting system-wide environment variables, see [Environment Variable Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#evgroups),
    in the Cloud Foundry Documentation.

### <a id='EnableSOCKS'></a>Starting a SOCKS proxy server

To start a HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, use the cf CLI, then switch to a SOCKS protocol in the Ops Manager UI and follow these steps:

  1. Click **App Metrics** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
  1. Go to **App Metrics Components Config** pane.
  1. Click **Enable Socks Proxy**. This check box sets the `USE_SOCKS_PROXY`
  environment variable and overrides the protocol for the proxy to use SOCKS instead of HTTP or HTTPS.

  1. Even though the HTTP or HTTPS proxy was overridden, you must begin by setting it. To set it, log in to the cf CLI and run:

      ```console
      cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o system -s app-metrics-v2
      ```

      Where:

      * `API-URL` is your API endpoint.
      * `USERNAME` is your username.
      * `PASSWORD` is your password.

  1. Update the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable:

      ```console
      cf set-env appmetrics HTTP_PROXY "http://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
      ```

      or

      ```console
      cf set-env appmetrics HTTPS_PROXY "https://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
      ```

      Where:

      * `PROXY-HOST` is the hostname of your HTTP or HTTPS proxy.
      * `PROXY-PORT` is the port that your HTTP or HTTPS proxy is listening on.

The HTTP proxy environment variables must be uppercase.

For more information
    about setting system-wide environment variables, see [Environment Variable Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#evgroups)
    in the Cloud Foundry Documentation.

## <a id='ConfigureFeatures'></a>Configuring App Metrics components (Optional)

To configure the settings for App Metrics components, including Log Store, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>App Metrics</strong> tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>App Metrics Components Config</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Deactivate <strong>Logs Drawer</strong> on the App Metrics dashboard,and deselect the <strong>App Metrics Enable Logs</strong> check box (the default setting is activated).</li>
<li>Set App Metrics Logs Prune Threshold disk capacity percentage (the default setting is 80%). This is the disk percentage that Log Store starts to prune starting with the oldest logs.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>App Metrics Logs Prune Interval</strong>. The default setting is two minutes). This is the frequency the Log Store checks the disk capacity to make your pruning decision.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureSyslog'> </a> Configuring syslog forwarding (Optional)

App Metrics supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service. For example Papertrail, Inc., Splunk Technology, or another custom enterprise log sink. You might find the VM logs useful for debugging problems in the system.

To enable remote syslog forwarding for Healthwatch:

1. Click **App Metrics** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

2. Go to the **Syslog** pane.

3. Select **Yes without encryption** or **Yes with TLS encryption** to activate syslog forwarding.

   * **External Syslog Host**: address of syslog server where you want logs sent. For example, [logs.example.com].
   * **External Syslog Port**: port of your syslog server. For example, [29279].
   * **External Syslog Protocol**: protocol for sending the logs.
   * **External Syslog Permitted Peer**: enter the fingerprint or name of the remote peer. For example, [*.example.com]. (TLS only).
   * **External Syslog TLS CA Certificate**: enter the CA certificate of the syslog destination.(TLS only).

## <a id='ConfigureMetricRegistrar'></a>Configuring Metric Registrar for Spring Boot Metrics (Optional)

For Metric Registrar to accurately report Spring Metrics, the configuration for Metric Registrar must be updated with the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) tile.

To update the Metric Registrar configuration:

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>TAS for VMs</strong> tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Metric Registrar</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Update the <strong>Blocked</strong> tags list and remove the `id` tag.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='AppManagerLinkConfig'></a> Activating the App Metrics link in Apps Manager (Optional)

Use this topic if **View in App Metrics** does not appear in Apps Manager and if App Metrics is deployed with one the following versions of TAS for VM:

* TAS for VMs v4.0
* TAS for VMs v3.0
* TAS for VMs v2.13
* TAS for VMs v2.12
* TAS for VMs v2.11

If your deployment has restrictive networking policies around your request proxy, the **View in App Metrics** link might not appear in Apps Manager.

To resolve this issue and activate the App Metrics link in Apps Manager:

1. Log in to cf CLI and run:

    ```console
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o system -s system
    ```

    Where:

    * `API-URL` is your API endpoint.
    * `USERNAME` is your username.
    * `PASSWORD` is your password.

2. Update the `no_proxy` environment variable for the `search-server` app to include your system domain:

    ```
    cf set-env search-server no_proxy '*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN'
    ```

    where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain configured for your deployment.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    cf set-env search-server no_proxy '*.example.com'
    </pre>

3. Restage the `search-server` app.

    ```console
    cf restage search-server
    ```
