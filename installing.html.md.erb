This document describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

To use the [Custom Metrics](./monitoringpcfmetrics.html#custom-metrics) feature of the PCF Metrics tile, you must have the Metrics Forwarder tile installed.
However, the PCF Metrics tile can be installed without the Metrics Forwarder tile.

For information about the components deployed as part of this install procedure,
see [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html).

##<a id='upgrade'></a>Upgrade from v1.4.x to v1.5.x

This section describes upgrading from PCF Metrics v1.4.x to v1.5.x.

###<a id='upgrade-overview'></a> Overview

PCF Metrics v1.5 includes new data storage solutions:

- For logs, v1.5 uses PostgreSQL instead of ElasticSearch.
- For metrics, v1.5 uses Percona instead of MariaDB.

There is no effective upgrade path from ElasticSearch to PostgreSQL for logs data. For this reason, the upgrade [Procedure](#upgrade-procedure) is different from previous versions.

###<a id='upgrade-procedure'></a> Procedure

To upgrade to PCF Metrics v1.5, Pivotal recommends that you follow this procedure:

1. Upload and install the PCF Metrics v1.5 tile alongside the v1.4 tile. Follow the instructions in the [Install PCF Metrics](#install) section below. <br>PCF Metrics v1.5 supports running both the v1.5 and v1.4 tiles simultaneously. You can install v1.5 manually or automate the installation with a deployment pipeline.
  <%= image_tag('images/ops-man-metrics-tiles-image.png', :alt => "PCF Metrics 1.4 and v1.5 installed in Ops Manager") %>
1. Keep both tiles installed and running for the duration of the logs and metrics retention window you configured in v1.5. This allows data to propagate to the new version.
  * During this time, you can access both dashboards. However, you can no longer access historical metrics and logs data on the v1.4 dashboard after the duration of the logs and metrics retention window you configured in v1.5 has passed.
      * **For v1.4**: Go to `metrics-previous.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
      * **For v1.5**: Go to `metrics.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`. You can also click **View Metrics in Previous Versions** on the v1.5 dashboard to see metrics for the current app on the v1.4 dashboard.

1. Uninstall PCF Metrics v1.4.

## <a id='install'></a> Install PCF Metrics

This section describes how to install the PCF Metrics tile.

### <a id='step1'></a> Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager

To add the PCF Metrics tile to Ops Manager, do the following:

1. Download the latest PCF Metrics v1.5 tile from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/apm).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click  **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to your **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id='step2'></a>Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following procedures offer a standard configuration.
              To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity,
              see the <a href="sizing.html">Sizing PCF Metrics for Your System</a>.</p>

1. From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.
1. Follow the procedures below to configure the PCF Metrics tile:
  + [Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks](#az)
  + [Configure Metrics Components](#mc-config)
  + [Configure Resources](#resource-config)
  + [Import Stemcell](#stemcell)

#### <a id='az'></a> Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
   <br>
   PCF Metrics should be installed on the same network the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile uses.
   However, if you do select a different subnet network, then refer to the table below when you configure
   the subnet network in the PAS tile to make sure that you have
   the ports needed for each of the PCF Metrics data services.

    <table border="1" class="nice">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Service</th>
          <th>Port</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>PostgreSQL (Logs Data)</td>
          <td>5524</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MySQL (Metrics Data)</td>
          <td>3306</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Redis (Data Caching and Aggregation)</td>
          <td>6379</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

1. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="mc-config"></a> Configure Metrics Components

1. Click **Metrics Components Config**.
1. Review the **MySQL Metrics Queue Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound metrics traffic.
1. Review the **PostgreSQL Logs Queue Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound log traffic.
1. Review the **Ingestor Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of Loggregator Firehose traffic.
1. Review the **Metrics API server instance count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate deployments with more apps, metrics, and logs.
1. Review the **Metrics Retention Window** value.
   You can set number of days to retain metrics data from `1` to `14` days.
   PCF Metrics adds one buffer day to your configured value to prevent pruning within your desired retention window. The retention window begins at UTC±00:00 of the current day and goes back the amount of days you enter in this field, plus the one buffer day added by PCF Metrics.
1. Review the **Logs Retention Window** value.
   You can set number of days to retain logs data from `1` to `14` days.
   PCF Metrics adds one buffer day to your configured value to prevent pruning within your desired retention window. The retention window begins at UTC±00:00 of the current day and goes back the amount of days you enter in this field, plus the one buffer day added by PCF Metrics.
1. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="resource-config"></a> Configure Resources

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job.
   For reference, the following table shows the default resource and IP requirements for installing the PCF Metrics tile:
  <table border="1" class="nice">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Resource</th>
      <th>Instances</th>
      <th>Persistent</th>
      <th>CPU</th>
      <th>RAM</th>
      <th>Ephemeral</th>
      <th>Static IP</th>
      <th>Dynamic IP</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>PostgreSQL Logs Storage</td>
      <td>1 (Not configurable)</td>
      <td>500&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>16&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>32&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Redis</td>
      <td>1 (Not configurable)</td>
      <td>100&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>4&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>8&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MySQL Metrics Storage</td>
      <td>1 (Not configurable)</td>
      <td>500&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>16&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>32&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
    If you expect a high level of use, you might need to increase the disk resources available to your instances.
    For more information, see [Sizing PCF Metrics for Your System](./sizing.html).

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For Ops Manager v1.9, if you configure a job with persistent disk larger than 2&nbsp;TB,
       you might experience disk partitioning issues with the BOSH Director.</p>
