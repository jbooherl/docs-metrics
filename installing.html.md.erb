<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>
 Before you begin your installation of App Metrics there are certain prerequisites you need to know.

Here are your prerequisites to install App Metrics:

<p> App Metrics v2.0 requires <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/Metric-Store/index.html" target="_blank">Metric Store</a> as its metrics datastore. You will need to install this tile before installing App Metrics.</p>

+ **If upgrading from the Metrics v1.x line:**
The App Metrics tile will install as a seperate tile and will not install over the v1.x version of the Metrics tile.
There is no data migration from the v1.x line to the v2.x line of the product.
To maintain historical data please install both tiles  side-by-side for two weeks before uninstalling the Metrics v1.x line.
    <p> App Metrics takes over the `metrics.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
        Turn off the `Push PCF Metrics Components Errand` for the Metrics v1.x tile to avoid install errors.
        Metrics v1.x is accessible at `metrics-previous.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
    </p>

## <a id='ConfigureProxy'></a>Configuring App Metrics to use HTTP or SOCKS proxy server (Optional)

You can configure App Metrics to use your HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy server for
Slack or webhook alerts.

### <a id='EnableHTTP'></a>Enabling an HTTP or HTTPS Proxy Server
Enable a HTTP or HTTPS Proxy Server through the cf CLI.

1. Log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o system -s app-metrics-v2
    ```
    Where:
    * `API-URL` is your API endpoint.
    * `USERNAME` is your username.
    * `PASSWORD` is your password.

1. Update the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable by running:

    ```
    cf set-env appmetrics HTTP_PROXY "http://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
    ```

    or

    ```
    cf set-env appmetrics HTTPS_PROXY "https://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
    ```

    Where:
    * `PROXY-HOST` is the hostname of your HTTP or HTTPS proxy.
    * `PROXY-PORT` is the port that your HTTP or HTTPS proxy is listening on.

    The HTTP proxy environment variables must be uppercase. For more information
    on setting system-wide environment variables, see [Environment Variable Groups]
    (https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#evgroups)
    in the Cloud Foundry Documentation.

### <a id='EnableSOCKS'></a>Starting a SOCKS proxy server

To start a HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, use the cf CLI, then switch to a SOCKS protocol in the Tanzu Operations Manager UI and follow these steps:

  1. Click **App Metrics** tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation Dashboard.
  1. Go to **App Metrics Components Config** pane.
  1. Click **Enable Socks Proxy**. This check box sets the `USE_SOCKS_PROXY`
  environment variable and overrides the protocol for the proxy to use SOCKS instead of HTTP or HTTPS.

      ```
      cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o system -s app-metrics-v2
      ```
      Where:
      * `API-URL` is your API endpoint.
      * `USERNAME` is your username.
      * `PASSWORD` is your password.

  1. Update the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable:

      ```
      cf set-env appmetrics HTTP_PROXY "http://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
      ```

      or

      ```
      cf set-env appmetrics HTTPS_PROXY "https://PROXY-HOST:PROXY-PORT"
      ```

      Where:
      * `PROXY-HOST` is the hostname of your HTTP or HTTPS proxy.
      * `PROXY-PORT` is the port that your HTTP or HTTPS proxy is listening on.

    The HTTP proxy environment variables must be uppercase. For more information
    on setting system-wide environment variables, see [Environment Variable Groups]
    (https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#evgroups)
    in the Cloud Foundry Documentation.

## <a id='ConfigureFeatures'></a>Configuring App Metrics components (Optional)

Here you can configure the settings for App Metrics components, including Log Store.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>App Metrics</strong> tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>App Metrics Components Config</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Deactivate <strong>Logs Drawer</strong> on the App Metrics dashboard,and deselect the <strong>App Metrics Enable Logs</strong> check box (the default setting is activated).</li>

<li>Set the <strong>App Metrics Logs Prune Interval</strong>. By default, the setting is two minutes).
This is the frequency the Log Store checks the disk capacity to make your pruning decision.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureSyslog'> </a> Configuring syslog forwarding (Optional)

App Metrics supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service. For example Papertrail, Inc., Splunk Technology, or another custom enterprise log sink.
You might find the VM logs useful for debugging problems in the system.

To enable remote syslog forwarding for Healthwatch:

1. Click **App Metrics** tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation Dashboard.

2. Go to the **Syslog** pane.

3. Select **Yes without encryption** or **Yes with TLS encryption** to activate syslog forwarding.

   * **External Syslog Host**: address of syslog server where you want logs sent. For example, [logs.example.com].
   * **External Syslog Port**: port of your syslog server. For example, [29279].
   * **External Syslog Protocol**: protocol for sending the logs.
   * **External Syslog Permitted Peer**: enter the fingerprint or name of the remote peer. For example, [*.example.com]. (TLS only).
   * **External Syslog TLS CA Certificate**: enter the CA certificate of the syslog destination.(TLS only).

## <a id='ConfigureMetricRegistrar'></a>Configuring Metric Registrar for Spring Boot Metrics (Optional)

For Metric Registrar to accurately report Spring Metrics, the configuration for Metric Registrar must be updated with the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) tile.

To update the Metric Registrar configuration:

To enable remote syslog forwarding for Healthwatch, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>TAS for VMs</strong> tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Metric Registrar</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Update the Blocked tags list and remove the `id` tag from the Blocked tags list.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='AppManagerLinkConfig'></a> Activating the App Metrics link in Apps Manager (Optional)

In order for Metric Registrar to accurately report Spring Metrics, the configuration for Metric Registrar must be updated in the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) or Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.

To update the Metric Registrar configuration, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Click the TAS for VMs or PAS tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Navigate to the Metric Registrar pane.</li>
<li>Update the Blocked tags list and remove the `id` tag from the list of Blocked tags.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='AppManagerLinkConfig'></a> (Optional) Enable the App Metrics Link in Apps Manager

Perform this step if the **View in App Metrics** does not appear in Apps Manager and App Metrics is deployed with one the following versions of TAS for VM or PAS:

- TAS for VMs v2.10.x
- TAS for VMs v2.9.x
- PAS v2.8.4 or later
- PAS v2.7.10 or later
- PAS v2.6.16 or later

The **View in App Metrics** link might not appear in Apps Manager if your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment has restrictive networking policies around request proxying.

To resolve this issue and enable the App Metrics link in Apps Manager:

1. Log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o system -s system
    ```
    Where:
    * `API-URL` is your API endpoint.
    * `USERNAME` is your username.
    * `PASSWORD` is your password.

1. Update the `no_proxy` environment variable for the `search-server` app to include your system domain.

    ```
    cf set-env search-server no_proxy '*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN'
    ```
    where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain configured for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    cf set-env search-server no_proxy '*.example.com'
    </pre>

1. Restage the `search-server` app.

    ```
    cf restage search-server
    ```
