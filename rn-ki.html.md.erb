## <a id='things-to-note'></a> Additional Notes

### <a id='things-to-note'></a> Network Metrics

If the app you are monitoring is not configured to accept HTTP traffic, no data is displayed on the **HTTP Request Count**, **HTTP Request Latency**, or
**HTTP Request Errors** charts.

### <a id='things-to-note'></a> PromQL source_id Tag

PromQL should always have the `source_id` tag for non-admin users. The `source_id` tag is used to verify access to the requested app. Without it, non-admin
users cannot receive data from the metric store.

App Metrics supports using a `$sourceId` parameter in PromQL, which automatically refers to the source ID of the current app. For example,
`cpu{source_id="$sourceId"}`.

### <a id='things-to-note'></a> Custom Metric Process Labels

App Metrics v2.1 introduces a new app hierarchy to support multiple process types from CAPI v3. Processes that contain the appropriate tagged envelopes are
available for metric filtering and are labeled accordingly  in the charts.

Some metrics, including custom and network metrics, might not have proper process tagging available. In these cases, `sourceId={'APP-ID'}` can be used, where
`APP-ID` is the source ID of your app.
