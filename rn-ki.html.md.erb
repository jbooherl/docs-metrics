## <a name="things-to-note"></a> Additional Items to Note

### Network Metrics

Please note that if the app you are monitoring is not configured to accept HTTP traffic, no data will be displayed on the HTTP Request Count, HTTP Request Latency, or HTTP Request Errors charts.

### Promql source_id tag

PromQL should always have the `source_id` tag for non-admin users.
The `source_id` tag is used to verify access to the requested application and without it non-admin users will not recieve data back from the metric store.
App Metrics supports using a $sourceId parameter in PromQL which automatically refers to the sourceId of the current app.
Example: cpu{source_id="$sourceId"}

### Custom Metric Process Labels

App Metrics v2.1 introduces a new app hierarchy to support multiple process types from CAPI v3. Processes that contain apporpriately tagged envelopes will be available for metric filtering, and will be labled accordingly within the charts.

There are some metrics, including custom and network metrics, that may not have proper process tagging available. In these cases, `sourceId={'YOUR_APP_ID'}` may be used.
