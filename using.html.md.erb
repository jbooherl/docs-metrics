You can monitor and troubleshoot apps using App Metrics.

## <a id="overview"></a> Understanding the health and performance of your apps

App Metrics helps you understand and troubleshoot the health and performance of your apps by offering the following indicators, data, and visualizations:

* [Latency](#latency): Response times for your app
* [Traffic](#traffic): Number of requests made for your app
* [Errors](#errors): HTTP errors thrown by your app
* [Saturation (Container Metrics)](#saturation): Three charts measuring CPU, memory, and disk consumption percentages
* [Custom Metrics](#custom-metrics): User-customizable charts for measuring app performance, such as Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer metrics, or user-defined custom business metrics
* [App Events](#events): A chart of update, start, stop, crash, SSH, and staging failure events
* [Logs](#logs): A list of app logs that you can search, filter, and download

The following sections describe a standard workflow for using App Metrics to monitor or troubleshoot your apps.

##<a id='get-started'></a> Viewing an App

In a browser, go to `metrics.sys.DOMAIN` and log in with your User Account and Authentication (UAA) credentials. Choose an app from the search bar for which you want to view metrics and/or logs. App Metrics respects UAA permissions such that you can view any app that runs in a space that you have access to.

App Metrics displays app data for a given time frame. See the sections below to [Change the Time Frame](#time) for the dashboard.

## <a id="time"></a>Changing the Time Frame

The charts show time along the horizontal axis. You can change the time frame for all charts and the logs by using the time selector options at the top of the window. You can select from several pre-set timescales or select a custom date range.

**Zoom**: From within any chart, click and drag to zoom in on areas of interest. This adjusts all of the charts, and the logs, to show data from that time frame.

In addition, from any chart, you can click and drag to zoom in on areas of interest. This adjusts all of the charts, and logs, to show data for that time frame.

Auto-refresh mode allows the metrics charts and logs on your dashboard to be updated on a timed interval as data is ingested.

To enable auto-refresh, click the **REFRESH** button next to the time selection options on the top right of the dashboard. This enables live updating of metrics and logs data for the currently selected timeframe.
Auto-refresh mode updates the metrics charts and logs on your dashboard for a timed interval as data is received.

<p> The default auto-refresh interval is set to one minute and is currently not configurable.</p>

## <a id="app-instance"></a>Viewing metrics at the process and App instance level

App Metrics relays metric data at the app process level to allow for an indepth troubleshooting experience, even across a rolling deployment. You are able to view the app metrics that are related to a specific process and focus in further to the specific instances within those processes. This action correlates directly
with the processes and app instances in [Apps Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/dev-console.html).

The dashboard displays metrics aggregated across all processes by default. To view metrics by specific process, select a process type from the dropdown near the upper-left of the dashboard.

With a specific process type selected, the metrics charts display aggregate data from all instances within the selected process type.

To view metrics for the individual instances within the selected process, click the Instances radio button on the dashboard.

To view metrics for a specific app instance or selection of specific instances, select your instance or instances from the
legend of any chart on the dashboard and click the **Instances** radio button.

##<a id='metrics'></a> Interpreting metrics

The default metrics charts included with App Metrics provide high-level indicators
of the Four Golden Signals for monitoring the health of apps running on distributed systems:
Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation.

The following sections explain how to use each of the charts on the dashboard to monitor and troubleshoot your app.

### <a id='networkMetrics'></a> Network metrics

<p> If apps are not configured for network traffic,
they show No Data or zeros for the default Latency, Traffic, and Errors metrics.
</p>

#### <a id='latency'></a> Latency

* Average latency of a request in milliseconds:<br><br>A spike in response time means your users are waiting longer. Scaling app instances can spread that workload over more resources and result in faster response times.

#### <a id='traffic'></a> Traffic

* Number of network requests per minute:<br><br>A spike in HTTP requests means more users are using your app. Scaling app instances can reduce the response time.

#### <a id='errors'></a> Errors

* Number of network request errors per minute:<br><br>A spike in HTTP errors means one or more 5xx errors have occurred. Check your app logs for more information.


### <a id='saturation'></a> Saturation (Container Metrics)

The following **Container Metrics** charts are available on the App Metrics dashboard to help monitor resource saturation:

* CPU usage percentage:<br><br>A spike in CPU might point to a process that is computationally heavy. Scaling app instances can relieve the immediate pressure, but you need to investigate the app to better understand and fix the root cause.<br><br>

* Memory usage percentage:<br><br>A consistent, gradual increase in memory might mean a resource leak in the code. Scaling app memory can relieve the immediate pressure, but you need to find and resolve the underlying issue so that it does not occur again.<br><br>

* Disk usage percentage:<br><br>A spike in disk might mean the app is writing logs to files instead of STDOUT, caching data to local disk, or serializing large sessions to disk.

### <a id='events'></a> Events

 The **Events** chart helps to correlate the metrics to events for your app.
 They include:

<p> The <b>SSH</b> event corresponds to someone successfully using SSH to access a container that runs an instance of the app.</p>

See the following topics for more information about app events:

* [Starting, restarting, and restaging Apps](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/deploy-apps-start-restart-restage.html)
* [Troubleshooting App deployment and health](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/deploy-apps-troubleshoot-app-health.html)

You can add custom metrics charts to your dashboard, including Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer metrics, by defining the custom metrics you want to monitor and including them in an indicator document for your app.

In order to get custom, Actuator, or Micrometer metrics into the Metrics Store, you need to bind Metric Registrar to your app and register your endpoint. For more information, see [Configuring the Metric Registrar](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/metric-registrar/index.html).

If you want to view custom metrics, you can configure your apps to emit those metrics out of
the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/loggregator-architecture.html) and then view these metrics on the App Metrics dashboard.

In addition, Spring Boot apps with actuators or Micrometer metrics implemented
emit [these metrics](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html) out of the box, without any changes to source code.

###<a id='metric-registrar-settings'></a> Metric Registrar Configuration for Spring Metrics

In order for Metric Registrar to accurately report Spring Metrics, the configuration for Metric Registrar must be updated in the Tanzu Application Service Tile.

The `id` tag needs to be removed from the list of Blocked tags in the Metric Registrar settings withing the Tanzu Application Service Tile.

###<a id='create-indicator-doc'></a> Creating an Indicator document

An Indicator document is a YAML document that specifies which app you want to monitor and the indicators
you want to use to monitor it.

There are three steps to creating an indicator document:

1. Find the metric you want to monitor.
2. Write the PromQL query.
3. Add the PromQL to your Indicator document.

#### Finding the metric name

First verify that the metrics are being emitted.
After you have configured Metrics Registrar to scrape your metrics
endpoint, you can verify your respective endpoint for metric names.

If you are using a Prometheus-style metrics endpoint, you can do so by hitting your app's metrics endpoint at
`app.domain/metrics` and looking for the desired metric.

To validate Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer metrics,
see [Metrics](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html)
in _Spring Boot Actuator: Production-ready Features_ in the Spring Boot documentation.

### Writing a PromQL query

After you have the metric name, write a PromQL query for visualizing the metric.

1. Find additional example PromQL for any of the default charts on the dashboard
   by clicking **Info** in the upper-right of any chart or visit the
   [PromQL Query examples](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/examples/) documentation.

2. Use the PromQL Explorer to test out PromQL before putting it in an indicator document:

    1. Click the **+** button at the bottom right of the dashboard.

    2. Test out queries to see how the graph looks before placing it in an indicator document.

    <p> PromQL must have the <code>source_id</code> tag for non-admin users.
  App Metrics supports using a <code>$sourceId</code> parameter in the PromQL which automatically refers to the sourceId of
  the current app. Example: <code>cpu{source_id="$sourceId"}</code>
</p>

#### Adding the PromQL to your Indicator document

When the PromQL is ready, put it in an indicator document.

For example, if you have a custom metric `customMetricName500` and want to graph the amount of errors over a 1 minute
period, then your PromQL query is `sum(avg_over_time(customMetricName500{source_id=\"$sourceId\"}[1m]))`.
The following is an example of the YAML for an indicator document:

<pre>
---
apiVersion: indicatorprotocol.io/v1
kind: IndicatorDocument

metadata:
  labels:
    deployment: "my deployment name"

spec:
  product:
    name: org,space,app-name
    version: 0.0.1

  indicators:
    - name: CustomErrorCount500
      promql: "sum(rate(customMetricName500{source_id='$sourceId'}[1m]))"
      documentation:
        title: "Custom Metric 500 Errors"
      presentation:
        units: "none"
</pre>

The  `org,space,app-name` in the example above determines which app these indicators are applied to.
Replace `org,space,app-name` with the org, space, and app name of the app dashboard that you want to customize.

### <a id="indicator-document-schema"></a> Indicator document schema

App Metrics uses a derivative version of the Indicator Protocol.
For more information about the App Metrics-supported indicator document schema,
see [Indicator Document Template Reference](./indicator-document-reference.html).

## <a id='monitoring'></a> Custom monitoring and alerting

You can add custom monitoring and alerting to your dashboard indicators by creating a Monitor document for your app.

### Creating a Monitor document

Monitors are linked to specific indicators, so the first step to adding custom monitoring and alerting to your
app is to verify the names of the indicators you would like to monitor.

You can view the indicator names for each chart on your app's dashboard by pointing to the desired chart,
clicking the three vertical dots and clicking **Info**.

The indicator name can correspond to one of your custom indicators or to one of the default indicator names:
RequestCount, HttpLatency, ErrorCount, CPU, MemoryPercentage, and DiskPercentage.

Once you have the indicator names you can create your Monitor document that defines threshold for your indicator
and the webhook to send alerts to. The following is an example of the YAML for an monitor document:

<pre>
---
After you have the indicator names create your Monitor document that defines the threshold for your indicator
and the webhook to send alerts to.

The following example is an YAML file for an Monitor document:

```yaml
product: org,space,app-name

webhook_url: https://my-slack-webhook.com

monitors:
  - name: 500 Errors For Application
    indicator: ErrorCount
    warning:
       operator: gte
       threshold: 1.0
       duration: 1m
       only_every: 1h
    critical:
       operator: gte
       threshold: 2.0
       duration: 1m
       only_every: 15m
</pre>

Please note that `org,space,app-name` is responsible for defining which app these indicators apply to.
Please replace this with the org, space, and app name of the app you wish to monitor.

Please also note that the `https://my-slack-webhook.com` should be where alerts are sent when a threshold is surpassed.
Slack is the currently the only supported use case, but other webhook platforms may work if they accept a "text" payload.

##<a id="logs"></a>Logs

The **Logs** view displays app log data ingested from the Loggregator Reverse Log Proxy (RLP):

<p> Logs with non-UTF-8 characters or non standard UUID app GUIDs are not stored.</p>

You can interact with the **Logs** view in the following ways:

* **Keyword**: Perform a keyword search. While filtering on keywords, logs results are reduced to only display log lines that contain the matching criteria. Matching terms are also highlighted in blue.
* **Highlight**: Enter a term to visually highlight within your search. The terms are highlighted in orange within the current filter results.
* **Sources**: Choose which sources to display logs from. For more information, see [Log Types and Their Messages](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/deploy-apps-streaming-logs.html).
* **Download**: Download a file containing logs for the current search.
* **Copy**: Click the copy icon to copy the text of the log.

By default, the most recent 1,000 log lines are displayed in the logs drawer. You can click `SHOW 1000 MORE LOGS` to load more.

##<a id="direct-data-access"></a> Direct Data Access

You can query Metric Store and Log Store directly to access the raw data.
